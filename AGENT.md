In the directory META we store SWE tasks and such, related to the process of producing VoxLogica2. Dev documentation as such is part of the artifact and currently in the doc directory.

All files in META are important. GUIDE.md is the main guide.

MANDATORY: For any request I make in chat about requirements, tasks, issues, whatever, make a formal record in META. The structure is flexible, emergent, do not prepare templates, scripts or set boundaries, just operate the META dir as if you were a senior software engineer and developer.

MANDATORY: At the start of a new chat, confirm you know all the rules by writing READY so I know you read until this last line.

MANDATORY: The AI is responsible for keeping the META directory and GUIDE.md up to date, concise, and free of redundancy.

MANDATORY: In any chat, when executing any command, it is required to follow the policies in the META directory and all SWE decisions therein.

MANDATORY: The AI must keep a working memory in META where a record of ongoing activities is maintained. It is MANDATORY to read this working memory at the start of each chat, and to keep it tidy and up to date at all times.

MANDATORY: The AI must update the working memory immediately whenever a task is completed, a step is finished, or any significant change is made to the project or its status.

MANDATORY: The AI is responsible for checking and maintaining the documentation (in doc/) so that it is accurate with respect to the current implementation, and must act on changes appropriately.

MANDATORY: The AI MUST always verify its answers before responding to any user question. This is to be treated as a core agent policy.
