"""
Static Buffer Allocation for DAG Execution

This module implements the static buffer reuse algorithm described in the sketch solution.
Given a workplan (DAG), a type assignment function, and a type compatibility function,
it computes an optimal buffer allocation that minimizes memory usage while ensuring
correctness (no overlapping lifetimes and type compatibility).

The algorithm uses a greedy chain decomposition approach based on Dilworth's theorem.
