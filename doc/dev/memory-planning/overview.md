# Overview: Static Buffer Reuse and Memory Planning

This document provides a high-level overview and motivation for static buffer reuse and memory planning in the execution of computational DAGs. Efficient memory management is crucial for large-scale scientific and machine learning workflows, where minimizing memory footprint can enable larger problems to be solved and improve performance.

## Motivation
- Reduce peak memory usage by reusing buffers for non-overlapping outputs.
- Enable static preallocation of memory, avoiding dynamic allocation overhead.
- Lay the groundwork for efficient execution on both CPU and GPU backends.
