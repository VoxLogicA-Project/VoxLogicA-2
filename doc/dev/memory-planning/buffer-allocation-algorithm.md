# Buffer Allocation Algorithm: Lifetime-Based Static Memory Reuse for DAG Execution

## Abstract

We present a polynomial-time algorithm for static buffer allocation in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) representing computational workflows. The algorithm minimizes memory usage by reusing buffers among operations with non-overlapping lifetimes while respecting type compatibility constraints. We provide formal correctness proofs, complexity analysis, and optimality discussions.

## 1. Introduction and Problem Definition

### 1.1 Motivation

In computational DAGs representing scientific workflows or machine learning pipelines, operations consume input data and produce output data stored in memory buffers. Naive allocation assigns a unique buffer to each operation, leading to excessive memory usage. Static buffer reuse can dramatically reduce peak memory requirements by sharing buffers among operations whose lifetimes do not overlap.

### 1.2 Formal Problem Statement

**Input:**
- A directed acyclic graph `G = (V, E)` where `V` represents operations and `E` represents data dependencies
- A type assignment function `τ: V → T` mapping each operation to a data type
- A type compatibility relation `≈ ⊆ T × T` (equivalence relation: reflexive, symmetric, and transitive)

**Output:**
- A buffer assignment function `β: V → ℕ` mapping each operation to a buffer identifier

**Constraints:**
1. **Lifetime Non-Overlap:** If `β(u) = β(v)` for distinct operations `u, v ∈ V`, then their lifetimes must not overlap
2. **Type Compatibility:** If `β(u) = β(v)`, then `τ(u) ≈ τ(v)`
3. **Correctness:** Every operation must be assigned exactly one buffer

**Objective:**
Minimize `|{β(v) : v ∈ V}|` (the number of distinct buffers used)

### 1.3 Lifetime Definition

The lifetime of an operation `v ∈ V` is the interval `[start(v), end(v)]` where:
- `start(v)` = topological position of `v` (when `v` is computed)
- `end(v)` = `max{start(u) : u ∈ dependents(v)}` if `dependents(v) ≠ ∅`, otherwise `start(v)`

Two lifetimes `[s₁, e₁]` and `[s₂, e₂]` **overlap** if and only if `¬(e₁ < s₂ ∨ e₂ < s₁)`.

## 2. Algorithm Description

Our algorithm employs a greedy approach with reverse topological ordering to maximize reuse opportunities. The key insight is that processing operations in reverse topological order (outputs before inputs) allows earlier operations to reuse buffers from later operations whose lifetimes have ended.

### 2.1 High-Level Approach

1. **Preprocessing:** Compute dependency graph, topological ordering, and operation lifetimes
2. **Greedy Assignment:** For each operation in reverse topological order, attempt to reuse an existing compatible buffer with non-overlapping lifetime
3. **Allocation:** If no suitable buffer exists, allocate a new buffer

### 2.2 Key Data Structures

- `topo_order`: List of operations in topological order
- `lifetimes`: Mapping from operations to lifetime intervals
- `buffer_allocation`: Mapping from operations to buffer IDs
- `buffer_to_operations`: Mapping from buffer IDs to sets of operations using that buffer
- `type_to_buffers`: Mapping from types to lists of available buffer IDs

```

## 4. Correctness Proof

**Theorem 1 (Correctness):** The BufferAllocation algorithm produces a valid buffer assignment satisfying all constraints.

**Proof:**

*Termination:* The algorithm processes each operation exactly once in the main loop (line 3.1), and each iteration performs a constant amount of work plus the FindCompatibleBuffer subroutine which examines at most |V| operations. Since |V| is finite, the algorithm terminates.

*Every operation gets a buffer:* In the main loop, for each operation v, either we assign an existing buffer (line 3.5) or create a new buffer (line 3.8). Thus every operation is assigned exactly one buffer.

*Type compatibility:* When reusing a buffer (line 3.5), we only consider buffers from `type_to_buffers[type]` where `type = τ(v)` (lines 3.2-3.3). New buffers are added to the correct type category (line 3.10). Therefore, all operations sharing a buffer have the same type.

*Lifetime non-overlap:* The FindCompatibleBuffer subroutine (lines 3.3-3.5) explicitly checks that the lifetime of v does not overlap with any operation already assigned to the candidate buffer. A buffer is returned only if no conflicts are found (line 3.6). Therefore, no two operations with overlapping lifetimes share the same buffer. □

**Theorem 2 (Lifetime Correctness):** The computed lifetimes correctly capture when each operation's result is needed.

**Proof:**

*Lower bound:* An operation v cannot have `end_time < start_time` since if `dependents[v] = ∅`, then `end_time = start_time` (line 2.3), and if `dependents[v] ≠ ∅`, then `end_time = max{position[u] : u ∈ dependents[v]} ≥ position[v] = start_time` by the topological ordering property.

*Upper bound optimality:* The operation v's result is needed until the latest of its direct dependents is computed. Since we use `max{position[u] : u ∈ dependents[v]}`, this correctly captures the latest time v's result is required. After this time, v's result is no longer needed and its buffer can be reused. □

## 5. Complexity Analysis

**Theorem 3 (Time Complexity):** The BufferAllocation algorithm runs in O(V³ + VE) time in the worst case.

**Proof:**

*Preprocessing:*
- BuildDependencyGraph: O(V + E) to traverse all operations and dependencies
- TopologicalSort: O(V + E) using Kahn's algorithm  
- ComputeLifetimes: O(V²) in worst case, since each operation may have O(V) dependents

*Main Loop:* O(V) iterations, each performing:
- FindCompatibleBuffer: O(B·O) where B is max buffers per type and O is max operations per buffer
- In worst case: B ≤ V and O ≤ V, so O(V²) per iteration
- Total main loop: O(V³)

*Overall:* O(V + E + V² + V³) = O(V³ + VE)

**Note:** This complexity is suboptimal compared to known results for interval graph coloring, which can be solved in O(V log V + E) time. □

**Space Complexity:** O(V + E) for storing the graph, dependency relationships, and buffer assignments.

## 6. Optimality Analysis

### 6.1 Optimality Conditions

**Theorem 4 (Optimal Cases):** The algorithm produces optimal solutions when:
1. All operations have the same type, OR
2. The DAG is a tree (no operation has multiple dependents), OR  
3. No two operations have overlapping lifetimes

**Proof Sketch:**
- Case 1: Reduces to interval scheduling with identical types - greedy is optimal
- Case 2: Tree structure ensures no complex lifetime interactions - greedy scheduling optimal
- Case 3: All operations can potentially share buffers - trivially optimal (1 buffer per type) □

### 6.2 Suboptimality Examples

The algorithm can be suboptimal due to its greedy nature and reverse topological processing order.

**Example 1 (Type-induced suboptimality):**
```
DAG: a:Type1 → c:Type2, b:Type1 → c:Type2
Optimal: 2 buffers (a,b share; c separate)  
Our algorithm: 3 buffers (processes c first, then a,b separately)
```

**Example 2 (Order-induced suboptimality):**
Consider operations with overlapping lifetimes where a different allocation order could achieve better packing. The reverse topological order is a heuristic that works well in practice but doesn't guarantee global optimality.

### 6.3 Approximation Ratio

**Conjecture:** The algorithm may achieve approximation bounds for certain classes of DAGs, but formal analysis requires deeper investigation of the interaction between topological constraints and type compatibility. Further research is needed to establish concrete approximation ratios.

## 7. Worst-Case Scenarios

1. **Maximum Fragmentation:** When many short-lived operations of different types are interleaved, preventing any buffer reuse
2. **Deep Dependencies:** Long chains where every operation depends on many previous operations, creating long lifetimes
3. **Type Diversity:** When every operation has a unique type, forcing one buffer per operation

**Worst-case space complexity:** O(V) buffers when no reuse is possible.

## 8. Implementation Considerations

### 8.1 Practical Optimizations

1. **Early Termination:** In FindCompatibleBuffer, sort buffers by number of assigned operations (prefer less crowded buffers)
2. **Type Clustering:** Group compatible types to reduce search space
3. **Lifetime Pruning:** Precompute lifetime overlap matrix for faster conflict detection

### 8.2 Variants and Extensions

1. **Forward Processing:** Process in forward topological order (may yield different results)
2. **Weighted Objectives:** Incorporate buffer size or access cost into the objective function
3. **Online Variants:** Handle dynamic DAG construction or modification
