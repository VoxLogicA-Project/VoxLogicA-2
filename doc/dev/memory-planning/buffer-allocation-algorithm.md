# Buffer Allocation Algorithm

## Overview

The buffer allocation algorithm implemented in VoxLogicA is designed to assign operation results to a minimal number of memory buffers while respecting type compatibility and lifetime constraints. This algorithm is fundamentally based on register allocation techniques from compiler design, adapted for the specific needs of static analysis and task graph execution.

## Algorithm Conception

### Motivation

In VoxLogicA's execution model, operations produce intermediate results that must be stored in memory buffers. The key challenges are:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Minimize the total number of buffers used
2. **Type Safety**: Operations with incompatible types cannot share the same buffer
3. **Lifetime Conflicts**: Operations whose lifetimes overlap cannot use the same buffer
4. **Execution Order**: Respect dependencies between operations

### Theoretical Foundation

The algorithm is based on the **interval scheduling problem** and **graph coloring** approaches from register allocation theory. The core insight is that buffer allocation is analogous to register allocation in compilers:

- **Operations** ↔ **Variables/Live ranges**
- **Buffers** ↔ **Registers**
- **Type compatibility** ↔ **Register class constraints**
- **Lifetime conflicts** ↔ **Interference**

## Algorithm Description

### Key Data Structures

The algorithm uses several key data structures:

1. **Dependencies Graph**: Maps each operation to its dependencies (parents)
2. **Dependents Graph**: Maps each operation to operations that depend on it (children)
3. **Topological Order**: Linear ordering of operations respecting dependencies
4. **Lifetimes**: For each operation, computes `(start_time, end_time)` interval
5. **Buffer Assignment**: Maps operation IDs to buffer IDs

### Main Algorithm Steps

#### 1. Dependency Graph Construction

```python
def _build_dependency_graph(workplan):
    dependencies = defaultdict(set)  # op -> {ops it depends on}
    dependents = defaultdict(set)    # op -> {ops that depend on it}

    for operation_id, operation in workplan.operations.items():
        for arg_name, dependency_id in operation.arguments.items():
            if dependency_id in workplan.operations:
                dependencies[operation_id].add(dependency_id)
                dependents[dependency_id].add(operation_id)
```

#### 2. Topological Sorting

Uses **Kahn's algorithm** to compute a topological ordering:

```python
def _topological_sort(workplan, dependencies):
    in_degree = {op: len(dependencies.get(op, set()))
                 for op in workplan.operations}
    queue = deque([op for op in workplan.operations if in_degree[op] == 0])
    result = []

    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        result.append(current)
        # Update in-degrees of dependents
        for op_id, deps in dependencies.items():
            if current in deps:
                in_degree[op_id] -= 1
                if in_degree[op_id] == 0:
                    queue.append(op_id)
```

#### 3. Lifetime Computation

Computes the lifetime interval for each operation:

```python
def _compute_operation_lifetimes(workplan, dependents, topo_order):
    position = {op_id: i for i, op_id in enumerate(topo_order)}
    lifetimes = {}

    for op_id in workplan.operations:
        start_time = position[op_id]
        deps = dependents.get(op_id, set())
        if deps:
            end_time = max(position[dep] for dep in deps)
        else:
            end_time = start_time
        lifetimes[op_id] = (start_time, end_time)
```

#### 4. Buffer Allocation

The core allocation algorithm processes operations in **reverse topological order**:

```python
def compute_buffer_allocation(workplan, type_assignment, type_compatibility):
    # ... setup phase ...

    # Process operations in reverse topological order
    for op_id in reversed(topo_order):
        op_type = type_assignment(op_id)

        # Compute descendants (all reachable children)
        descendants = compute_descendants(op_id, dependents)

        assigned = False
        for buffer_id, ops in buffer_to_operations.items():
            # Check constraints
            if can_assign_to_buffer(op_id, buffer_id, ops,
                                  type_assignment, type_compatibility,
                                  dependents, lifetimes, descendants):
                # Assign to existing buffer
                buffer_allocation[op_id] = buffer_id
                buffer_to_operations[buffer_id].add(op_id)
                assigned = True
                break

        if not assigned:
            # Create new buffer
            buffer_allocation[op_id] = next_buffer_id
            buffer_to_operations[next_buffer_id] = {op_id}
            next_buffer_id += 1
```

### Conflict Detection

The algorithm checks three types of conflicts before assigning an operation to a buffer:

#### 1. Type Compatibility Conflict

```python
# All operations in the buffer must have compatible types
if not all(type_compatibility(type_assignment(u), op_type) for u in ops):
    conflict = True
```

#### 2. Parent-Child Conflict

```python
# Direct child cannot use same buffer as parent
if u in dependents.get(op_id, set()):
    conflict = True
```

#### 3. Concurrency Conflict

```python
# Operations must have ancestor-descendant relationship
if u not in descendants:
    conflict = True
```

#### 4. Lifetime Overlap Conflict

```python
# Lifetime intervals must not overlap
(start_v, end_v) = lifetimes[op_id]
(start_u, end_u) = lifetimes[u]
if not (end_u < start_v or end_v < start_u):
    conflict = True
```

## Correctness Proof

### Theorem: The algorithm produces a valid buffer allocation

**Proof by contradiction and construction:**

#### Lemma 1: Type Safety

**Claim**: All operations assigned to the same buffer have compatible types.

**Proof**: The algorithm only assigns operation `v` to buffer `b` if `type_compatibility(type_assignment(u), type_assignment(v))` returns `True` for all operations `u` already in buffer `b`. Since type compatibility is assumed to be symmetric and transitive, all operations in the same buffer are mutually compatible. □

#### Lemma 2: No Parent-Child Conflicts

**Claim**: A parent operation and its direct child are never assigned to the same buffer.

**Proof**: Before assigning operation `v` to buffer `b`, the algorithm checks if any operation `u ∈ b` satisfies `u ∈ dependents[v]` (i.e., `u` is a direct child of `v`). If this condition holds, `v` is not assigned to buffer `b`. □

#### Lemma 3: Concurrency Constraint

**Claim**: Operations assigned to the same buffer have an ancestor-descendant relationship.

**Proof**: The algorithm computes `descendants[v]` as all operations reachable from `v` in the dependency graph. Before assigning `v` to buffer `b`, it verifies that all operations `u ∈ b` satisfy `u ∈ descendants[v]`. This ensures that either `u` is a descendant of `v`, or `v` will be a descendant of `u` (when `v` is processed in reverse topological order). □

#### Lemma 4: No Lifetime Overlap

**Claim**: Operations assigned to the same buffer do not have overlapping lifetimes.

**Proof**: For operations `u` and `v` with lifetimes `(start_u, end_u)` and `(start_v, end_v)`, the algorithm only assigns them to the same buffer if `end_u < start_v OR end_v < start_u`. This ensures their lifetime intervals are disjoint. □

#### Main Theorem

The combination of Lemmas 1-4 ensures that:

1. All operations in the same buffer can safely share memory (type compatibility)
2. Dependencies are respected (no parent-child conflicts)
3. Execution semantics are preserved (concurrency and lifetime constraints)

Therefore, the algorithm produces a **valid buffer allocation**. □

### Optimality Analysis

#### Theorem: The algorithm is not optimal but provides good heuristics

**Proof of non-optimality**: Consider this counterexample:

- Operations: A → B → C, A → D → C
- Types: All operations have compatible types
- Optimal solution: 2 buffers (A,C) and (B,D)
- Algorithm result: 3 buffers due to reverse topological order processing

However, the algorithm provides several good heuristic properties:

1. **Greedy Optimality**: At each step, it assigns to the first compatible buffer found
2. **Reverse Order Benefits**: Processing in reverse topological order tends to group operations with shorter lifetimes
3. **Ancestor-Descendant Grouping**: The concurrency constraint naturally groups related operations

## Relationship to Register Allocation

### Connection to Linear Scan Algorithm

The VoxLogicA algorithm shares key concepts with linear scan register allocation:

1. **Interval-Based Thinking**: Both use lifetime intervals to determine conflicts
2. **Greedy Assignment**: Both make greedy choices about resource assignment
3. **Reverse Processing**: Both can benefit from reverse order processing

### Key Differences

| Aspect          | Register Allocation       | Buffer Allocation          |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Order**       | Forward scan of intervals | Reverse topological order  |
| **Conflicts**   | Overlap-based             | Dependency + overlap-based |
| **Constraints** | Register classes          | Type compatibility         |
| **Spilling**    | To memory                 | Not applicable             |
| **Goal**        | Minimize memory access    | Minimize buffer count      |

### Comparison to Graph Coloring

The algorithm can also be viewed as a constrained graph coloring problem:

- **Nodes**: Operations
- **Edges**: Lifetime conflicts + dependency conflicts
- **Colors**: Buffers
- **Constraint**: Type compatibility within each color class

However, unlike pure graph coloring, the algorithm uses the dependency structure to guide allocation decisions.

## Performance Characteristics

### Time Complexity

- **Dependency graph construction**: O(E) where E is number of dependencies
- **Topological sort**: O(V + E) where V is number of operations
- **Lifetime computation**: O(V)
- **Main allocation loop**: O(V × B × D) where B is number of buffers, D is max descendants
- **Overall**: O(V × B × D + E)

### Space Complexity

- **Dependency graphs**: O(V + E)
- **Lifetime storage**: O(V)
- **Buffer assignment**: O(V)
- **Overall**: O(V + E)

### Practical Performance

Based on typical VoxLogicA workloads:

- Most operations have small descendant sets
- Number of buffers grows slowly
- Algorithm scales well to thousands of operations

## Implementation Notes

### Type Compatibility

The algorithm is parameterized by a `type_compatibility` function that determines when two types can share a buffer. The default implementation uses equality (`t1 == t2`).

### Error Handling

The algorithm assumes:

- Acyclic dependency graph (ensured by topological sort)
- Valid type assignments for all operations
- Consistent dependency relationships

### Integration Points

The algorithm integrates with VoxLogicA's execution engine through:

- `WorkPlan` data structure containing operations
- Type assignment system
- Memory management layer for actual buffer allocation

## Future Optimizations

### Potential Improvements

1. **Better Heuristics**: Use operation frequency/importance for assignment decisions
2. **Live Range Splitting**: Allow operations to use multiple buffers across their lifetime
3. **Global Optimization**: Consider entire program structure for better grouping
4. **Type Hierarchy**: Support more sophisticated type compatibility relationships
