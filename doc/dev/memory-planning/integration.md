# Integration Notes: Dask, PyTorch, and Other Frameworks

This document provides notes and guidelines for integrating static buffer reuse and memory planning with parallel schedulers (such as Dask) and deep learning frameworks (such as PyTorch).

## Topics
- How to connect buffer assignment to task scheduling
- Considerations for CPU vs GPU memory
- Example integration patterns
