# VoxLogicA 2

This is the source code of the new iteration of the spatial model checker VoxLogicA. For now it just does parsing and source-code optimization.

## Quick Start

There's a convenience script in the root directory to run VoxLogicA:

```bash
# Run VoxLogicA without manually activating the virtual environment
./voxlogica run test.imgql

# Show help
./voxlogica --help

# Show version
./voxlogica version
```

This script automatically activates the virtual environment and runs the Python implementation.

For detailed documentation, see:

- Implementation documentation: `implementation/python/README.md`
