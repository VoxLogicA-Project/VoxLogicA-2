# VoxLogicA-2 Development Status

**Last Updated:** 20 giugno 2025

## Current State

The VoxLogicA-2 system has a working execution engine based on the `ExecutionSession` class that handles workplan execution using Dask delayed graphs. The core functionality is operational, but architectural questions remain about the execution strategy.

## Key Components Status

### âœ… Completed
- **Test Infrastructure**: Fully organized and documented with comprehensive policies
- **Basic Execution Engine**: Functional with content-addressed storage
- **WorkPlan Compilation**: Reduces VoxLogicA programs to executable workplans
- **Storage Backend**: Content-addressed storage with SQLite backend
- **CLI Interface**: Basic command-line interface working
- **Primitives System**: Extensible primitive operations framework

### ðŸ”„ Under Investigation
- **ExecutionSession Architecture**: Current monolithic session approach needs evaluation

## Next Priority: ExecutionSession Analysis

### The Question
The current execution strategy uses a **monolithic `ExecutionSession` class** that handles the entire lifecycle of workplan execution. We need to determine whether this approach is optimal or if a different strategy would be better.

### Current ExecutionSession Approach
```python
class ExecutionSession:
    """
    Individual execution session that handles the actual compilation
    and execution of a workplan using Dask delayed.
    
    Manages the complete lifecycle of a single workplan execution:
    - Categorizes operations into pure computations vs side-effects
    - Compiles pure operations to Dask delayed graphs  
    - Handles distributed execution with content-addressed storage
    - Executes side-effect operations (print, save) after computations
    - Provides execution status and cancellation support
    """
```

### Key Analysis Areas

1. **Session Scope and Granularity**
   - Is one session per workplan the right abstraction?
   - Should sessions be smaller/larger in scope?
   - How does this impact parallelization and resource management?

2. **State Management**
   - How much state should a session maintain?
   - Is the current state tracking optimal for long-running executions?
   - Does the monolithic approach create memory or performance issues?

3. **Execution Strategy Alternatives**
   - **Micro-sessions**: One session per operation or small operation groups
   - **Streaming execution**: Process operations as they become ready
   - **Pipeline-based**: Break execution into distinct phases with handoffs
   - **Actor-based**: Individual actors for different execution concerns

4. **Coordination and Dependencies**
   - How well does the current approach handle complex dependency graphs?
   - Is the Dask integration optimal for our use case?
   - Should we consider alternative execution backends?

5. **Scalability Considerations**
   - How does the current approach scale with workplan size?
   - Memory usage patterns with large workplans
   - Network overhead and distribution efficiency

### Investigation Tasks

1. **Profile Current Implementation**
   - Analyze memory usage patterns of ExecutionSession
   - Measure execution time overhead of session management
   - Identify bottlenecks in the current approach

2. **Compare Alternative Architectures**
   - Design sketches for alternative execution strategies
   - Prototype key alternatives to measure performance differences
   - Evaluate complexity trade-offs

3. **Assess Integration Points**
   - How different execution strategies affect storage backend usage
   - Impact on content-addressed deduplication
   - CLI and API integration considerations

### Success Criteria

The analysis should result in:
- Clear understanding of current ExecutionSession strengths/weaknesses
- Documented comparison of alternative execution strategies
- Recommendation on whether to keep current approach or refactor
- If refactoring is recommended, a detailed migration plan

## Technical Debt Items

- `execution_id` parameter is unused throughout codebase (always auto-generated)
- Some test coverage gaps in execution edge cases
- Documentation could be more comprehensive for execution internals

## Recent Achievements

- Successfully migrated and organized all test infrastructure
- Established comprehensive SWE policies for test-issue linking
- Created detailed documentation for test organization and patterns
- All legacy test files properly integrated into test infrastructure

---

**Next Steps:** Begin systematic analysis of ExecutionSession architecture and alternative execution strategies. This is a critical architectural decision that affects system scalability, maintainability, and performance.
