# Distributed Execution Engine Implementation

## Status: IN PROGRESS

## Overview
Implementation of a distributed execution engine for VoxLogica-2 workplans that compiles DAGs to Dask lazy delayed graphs with persistent storage, content-addressed deduplication, and modular primitives system.

## Key Components
1. **Storage Backend** (`storage.py`) - SQLite with WAL mode, content-addressed storage
2. **Execution Engine** (`execution.py`) - DAG compilation and execution orchestration  
3. **Primitives System** (`primitives/`) - Modular operation definitions
4. **CLI Integration** (`features.py`) - Integration with `voxlogica run` command

## Architecture Decisions
- DAG nodes must be pure functions (no I/O operations)
- Print/save operations handled as workplan goals, not primitives
- Content-addressed storage using SHA256 for deduplication
- Thread-safe concurrent execution tracking
- Lazy evaluation using Dask delayed graphs

## Current Issues
1. Print/save incorrectly implemented as primitives - need to be handled as execution goals
2. Need proper Dask delayed graph compilation instead of simple task scheduling
3. CLI integration incomplete - missing --execute flag
4. Dependencies need updating in both requirements files

## Implementation Files
- `/implementation/python/voxlogica/storage.py` - Complete
- `/implementation/python/voxlogica/execution.py` - Needs architecture fix
- `/implementation/python/voxlogica/primitives/` - Core primitives done
- `/implementation/python/voxlogica/features.py` - Partially integrated
- `/doc/dev/dynamic-scheduler/README.md` - Documentation updated

## Next Steps
1. Fix execution engine architecture 
2. Implement proper Dask delayed compilation
3. Complete CLI integration
4. Update all dependencies
5. Test with test.imgql
