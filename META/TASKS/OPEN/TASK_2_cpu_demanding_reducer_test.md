# Task: CPU-demanding test for reducer (imgql Fibonacci-like chain)

## Summary

Create a test that is CPU-demanding for the reducer. This involves creating a series of imgql function declarations that use previous declarations in a Fibonacci-like (albeit non-recursive) fashion. The goal is to stress-test the reducer with a deep chain of dependent function calls.

## Issue

- GitHub Issue: https://github.com/VoxLogicA-Project/VoxLogicA-2/issues/2

## Status

- Task created and tracked in META and GitHub.
- Implementation not started.

## Next Steps

1. Design a sequence of imgql function declarations where each function depends on the previous two (Fibonacci-like, but non-recursive).
2. Implement the test in the appropriate test directory.
3. Run the test and verify that it is CPU-demanding for the reducer.
4. Document the test and its results.

## Traceability

- Task file and GitHub issue cross-referenced.
