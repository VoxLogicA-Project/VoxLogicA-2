# Working Memory: Completed Activities

## 1. Python Port of F# Implementation

- **Task File:** See [META/TASK_python_port.md](TASK_python_port.md)
- **Status:** COMPLETE. Implementation tested, all tests passing, documentation and CLI/API parity confirmed, and all required steps for feature completion executed.
- **Description:** Ported the F# implementation (parser, reducer, main) to Python, using Lark for parsing. All features implemented, modular, with CLI and HTTP API interfaces using FastAPI. CLI and API match exactly. Parser, reducer, error handling, CLI, and API server components implemented. Documentation and tests are up to date.
- **Traceability:**
  - GitHub Issue: https://github.com/VoxLogicA-Project/VoxLogicA-2/issues/1
  - Task file and issue cross-referenced.
  - All changes merged to main branch via pull request.
- **Documentation:** All relevant documentation (README, design docs, CLI/API docs) is up to date and accurate.
- **Testing:** All tests pass. Test suite covers the new implementation. No further test data in implementation directories.
- **Branch:** Feature branch merged and closed.
- **Details:**
  - Created Python implementation in `python/` directory
  - Used Lark for parsing, closely matching F# grammar
  - Implemented reducer logic for evaluating VoxLogicA programs
  - Created CLI with Typer that matches F# CLI options
  - Implemented API server with FastAPI with equivalent endpoints
  - Added test suite in `tests/` directory
  - Created necessary documentation
  - Fixed parsing issues with Lark transformer
  - Made key classes hashable to support operations and goals
- **Next Steps:**
  - Refactor repo: move all implementation code to implementation/ (with python/ and fsharp/ as subdirs)
  - Move all test data (imgql files) to the global tests/ directory
  - Ensure the test script in tests/ runs both Python and F# tests
  - Remove test data from implementation directories
  - Consider additional tests for more complex scenarios
  - Optimize performance if needed
  - Enhance documentation
