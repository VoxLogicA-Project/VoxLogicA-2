# Working Memory: Ongoing Activities

## 1. Python Port of F# Implementation

- **Task File:** See [META/TASK_python_port.md](TASK_python_port.md)
- **Status:** Implementation completed. Python port has been created with full feature parity to the F# implementation.
- **Description:** Ported the F# implementation (parser, reducer, main) to Python, using Lark for parsing. Implemented all features, ensuring modularity, and provided both CLI and HTTP API interfaces using FastAPI. CLI and API match exactly. Implemented parser, reducer, error handling, CLI, and API server components.
- **Details:**
  - Created Python implementation in `python/` directory
  - Used Lark for parsing, closely matching F# grammar
  - Implemented reducer logic for evaluating VoxLogicA programs
  - Created CLI with Typer that matches F# CLI options
  - Implemented API server with FastAPI with equivalent endpoints
  - Added test suite in `tests/` directory
  - Created necessary documentation
- **Next Steps:**
  - Test with real-world examples
  - Optimize performance if needed
  - Enhance documentation
