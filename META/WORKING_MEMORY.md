# Working Memory: Completed Activities

## 1. Python Port of F# Implementation

- **Issue File:** See [META/ISSUES/ISSUE_3/README.md](ISSUES/ISSUE_3/README.md)
- **Status:** COMPLETE. Implementation tested, all tests passing, documentation and CLI/API parity confirmed, and all required steps for feature completion executed.
- **Description:** Ported the F# implementation (parser, reducer, main) to Python, using Lark for parsing. All features implemented, modular, with CLI and HTTP API interfaces using FastAPI. CLI and API match exactly. Parser, reducer, error handling, CLI, and API server components implemented. Documentation and tests are up to date.
- **Traceability:**
  - GitHub Issue: https://github.com/VoxLogicA-Project/VoxLogicA-2/issues/1
  - Task file and issue cross-referenced.
  - All changes merged to main branch via pull request.
- **Documentation:** All relevant documentation (README, design docs, CLI/API docs) is up to date and accurate.
- **Testing:** All tests pass. Test suite covers the new implementation. No further test data in implementation directories.
- **Branch:** Feature branch merged and closed.
- **Details:**
  - Created Python implementation in `python/` directory
  - Used Lark for parsing, closely matching F# grammar
  - Implemented reducer logic for evaluating VoxLogicA programs
  - Created CLI with Typer that matches F# CLI options
  - Implemented API server with FastAPI with equivalent endpoints
  - Added test suite in `tests/` directory
  - Created necessary documentation
  - Fixed parsing issues with Lark transformer
  - Made key classes hashable to support operations and goals
- **Next Steps:**
  - Refactor repo: move all implementation code to implementation/ (with python/ and fsharp/ as subdirs)
  - Move all test data (imgql files) to the global tests/ directory
  - Ensure the test script in tests/ runs both Python and F# tests
  - Remove test data from implementation directories
  - Consider additional tests for more complex scenarios
  - Optimize performance if needed
  - Enhance documentation

## 2. CPU-demanding test for reducer (imgql Fibonacci-like chain)

- **Issue File:** See [META/ISSUES/ISSUE_4/README.md](ISSUES/ISSUE_4/README.md)
- **Status:** COMPLETE. Implementation finished, all tests pass, DAG saved, and documentation updated. Merged in commit SHA: c6a9837e7e235983143931e5c4a44ad2cbb1fb7b.
- **GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/VoxLogicA-Project/VoxLogicA-2/issues/2
- **Feature Branch:** feature/2-cpu-demainding-reducer-test
- **Description:** Created a test that is CPU-demanding for the reducer, using a series of imgql function declarations in a Fibonacci-like (non-recursive) chain to stress-test the reducer. Test extended to depth 100 (f100).
- **Traceability:**
  - Task file and GitHub issue cross-referenced.
  - Feature branch and merge commit SHA referenced.
- **Documentation:** All relevant documentation (README, design docs, CLI/API docs) is up to date and accurate.
- **Testing:** All tests pass. Test suite covers the new implementation.

# Working Memory: Ongoing Activities

## 3. CPU-demanding test for reducer using function declarations for combinatorial explosion

- **Issue File:** See [META/ISSUES/ISSUE_5/README.md](ISSUES/ISSUE_5/README.md)
- **Status:** PLANNING. Creating an implementation plan and designing a test file using function declarations to cause combinatorial explosion in the DAG.
- **GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/VoxLogicA-Project/VoxLogicA-2/issues/3
- **Description:** Create a test that causes combinatorial explosion in the workflow graph by using function declarations instead of constants. This is similar to the fibonacci chain task (Task 2) but using function declarations instead of constant declarations, which will cause the Workflow (DAG) size to grow combinatorially with respect to the imgql size.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Create feature branch
  - Design and implement test file with function declarations
  - Integrate the test into the Python and F# test runners
  - Run the test and verify combinatorial explosion
  - Document the test results
