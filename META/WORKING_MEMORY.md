## 2. CPU-demanding test for reducer (imgql Fibonacci-like chain)

- **Issue File:** See [META/ISSUES/ISSUE_2/README.md](ISSUES/ISSUE_2/README.md)
- **Status:** COMPLETE. Implementation finished, all tests pass, DAG saved, and documentation updated. Merged in commit SHA: c6a9837e7e235983143931e5c4a44ad2cbb1fb7b.
- **GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/VoxLogicA-Project/VoxLogicA-2/issues/2
- **Feature Branch:** feature/2-cpu-demainding-reducer-test
- **Description:** Created a test that is CPU-demanding for the reducer, using a series of imgql function declarations in a Fibonacci-like (non-recursive) chain to stress-test the reducer. Test extended to depth 100 (f100).
- **Traceability:**
  - Task file and GitHub issue cross-referenced.
  - Feature branch and merge commit SHA referenced.
- **Documentation:** All relevant documentation (README, design docs, CLI/API docs) is up to date and accurate.
- **Testing:** All tests pass. Test suite covers the new implementation.

## 5. Python Comment Parsing Issue in Lark Parser

- **Issue File:** See [META/ISSUES/ISSUE_5/README.md](ISSUES/ISSUE_5/README.md)
- **Status:** COMPLETE. Fixed the Python parser to handle comments correctly by modifying the OPERATOR pattern with a negative lookahead to exclude matching "//", simplifying the COMMENT pattern, and ensuring proper handling of line breaks.
- **GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/VoxLogicA-Project/VoxLogicA-2/issues/5
- **Feature Branch:** fix/5-python-comment-parsing
- **Description:** Fixed a bug where the Python parser failed to parse imgql files containing comments, raising an `UnexpectedToken` error when encountering comment lines. The fix ensures that comments are properly recognized and ignored by the Lark parser.
- **Traceability:**
  - Task file and GitHub issue cross-referenced.
  - Feature branch and merge commit SHA: 532075ad7494e07334738d3d6aa4e165bc3739b9
- **Documentation:** README.md updated with root cause analysis, solution details, and verification results.
- **Testing:** The fix has been verified with the test script, confirming that files with comments can now be parsed correctly.

## 6. Test: Ensure identical DAGs for same program in both ports (with JSON normalization)

- **Issue File:** See [META/ISSUES/ISSUE_6/README.md](ISSUES/ISSUE_6/README.md)
- **GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/VoxLogicA-Project/VoxLogicA-2/issues/6
- **Status:** OPEN. Need to create tests that show how the same program produces the same DAG in both the Python and F# ports, using JSON normalization for robust comparison.
- **Description:**
  - Generate 5 valid and representative imgql test cases.
  - For each, run both ports and obtain the resulting DAG as JSON.
  - Normalize the JSON using a standard procedure (e.g., sort keys, canonicalize numbers/strings).
  - Compare the normalized outputs to ensure they are identical.
  - Document the normalization procedure and any edge cases.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - At least 5 test cases are generated and included in the test suite.
  - The test suite runs both ports, normalizes the output, and compares them.
  - Any differences are reported with clear diagnostics.
  - Documentation is updated to describe the normalization and comparison process.

## 7. Feature: Export task graph as JSON (CLI option)

- **Status:** CLOSED. Implemented in both Python and F# ports, user documentation updated, and tested with a cross-language test file. See commit and GitHub issue for details.
- **Summary:**
  - Both ports now support a CLI option to export the task graph as JSON.
  - User documentation updated to reflect the new option.
  - Tested with a shared test file to confirm correct behavior in both implementations.
  - Issue closed on GitHub and locally.

## 8. Test Suite Execution After Reorganization

- **Status:** COMPLETE. All test suites were executed individually and collectively after the recent project reorganization. All tests passed without errors.
- **Description:** Verified the integrity of the test infrastructure by running:
  - `basic_test/test.py`
  - `fibonacci_chain/fibonacci_chain.py`
  - `function_explosion/function_explosion.py`
    Each test was run individually and then all were run in sequence to simulate a full suite run. The environment variable `PYTHONPATH=tests` was set to ensure correct module resolution.
- **Traceability:**
  - User request in chat to run all tests after reorganization.
  - Command outputs and results recorded in chat history.
- **Testing:**
  - `basic_test`: 4 operations, 1 goal, DAG saved.
  - `fibonacci_chain`: 100 operations, 1 goal, DAG saved.
  - `function_explosion`: 15490 operations, 1 goal, DAG saved.
  - No errors or failures encountered.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Maintain this test execution pattern for future reorganizations or major changes.
  - Consider automating the orchestration of all test scripts in a single runner for convenience.

## 8. User Documentation: CLI Options and User Docs

- **Status:** IN PROGRESS. Creating user documentation for the command line options of both the Python and F# ports, to be placed in a new `doc/user/` subfolder. The documentation will be referenced from the main documentation index (`doc/INDEX.md`) but kept in a separate subfolder for clarity and maintainability.
- **Description:**
  - Document the command line options for both the Python and F# ports, ensuring accuracy and clarity for end users.
  - Insert a reference to the new user documentation in the main documentation index.
  - Keep the user documentation in a dedicated subfolder (`doc/user/`) to avoid cluttering technical or design docs.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Ensure all documentation is accurate and up to date with respect to the current implementation.

# Working Memory: Ongoing Activities

## 3. CPU-demanding test for reducer using function declarations for combinatorial explosion

- **Issue File:** See [META/ISSUES/ISSUE_3/README.md](ISSUES/ISSUE_3/README.md)
- **Status:** PLANNING. Creating an implementation plan and designing a test file using function declarations to cause combinatorial explosion in the DAG.
- **GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/VoxLogicA-Project/VoxLogicA-2/issues/3
- **Description:** Create a test that causes combinatorial explosion in the workflow graph by using function declarations instead of constants. This is similar to the fibonacci chain task (Task 2) but using function declarations instead of constant declarations, which will cause the Workflow (DAG) size to grow combinatorially with respect to the imgql size.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Create feature branch
  - Design and implement test file with function declarations
  - Integrate the test into the Python and F# test runners
  - Run the test and verify combinatorial explosion
  - Document the test results

## 4. F# Stack Overflow Issue in Reducer

- **Issue File:** See [META/ISSUES/ISSUE_4/README.md](ISSUES/ISSUE_4/README.md)
- **Status:** OPEN. Investigating the F# implementation that crashes with a stack overflow when using function declarations with parameters and complex arithmetic operations.
- **GitHub Issue:** https://github.com/VoxLogicA-Project/VoxLogicA-2/issues/4
- **Description:** When running a function-based imgql file with operations that cause combinatorial explosion in the DAG, the F# implementation crashes with a stack overflow, particularly when using function declarations with parameters and complex arithmetic operations.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Create feature branch
  - Analyze the stack overflow root cause
  - Implement a fix for excessive recursion in the reducer
  - Consider adding memoization or tail-call optimization
  - Verify the fix with the test case
  - Document the solution

## 8. DAG Generation and Testing

- **Status:** ACTIVE. The DAG generation and testing infrastructure has been updated to focus on the Python implementation.
- **Description:** The DAG generation test suite has been refactored to test the Python implementation's DAG generation capabilities.
- **Features:**
  - Tests for basic DAG generation
  - Support for function definitions and calls
  - Arithmetic operation testing
  - JSON output validation
- **Next Steps:**
  - Add more comprehensive test cases
  - Enhance DAG validation
  - Improve error reporting in test failures
- **Next Steps:**
  - Ensure both implementations create operations in deterministic order
  - Either standardize the AST traversal order or implement semantic equivalence checking
  - Consider sorting operations by semantic content before comparison
  - Verify all test cases pass after fix
