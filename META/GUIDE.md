# META Directory Guide

## Purpose
The `META` directory stores repository-wide engineering policy only.

## Canonical Workflow
- **GitHub Issues are canonical** for backlog, status, priority, ownership, and closure.
- **Repository docs are canonical** for technical requirements and design decisions.

## How META Is Used
- **Policies:** Active policy lives in `META/SWE_POLICY.md`.

## Maintenance Rules
- Keep this directory concise and non-duplicative.
- Prefer links to canonical docs/issues over copying status in multiple places.
- Update GitHub issue state first, then update in-repo requirement/design docs as needed.
