# META Directory Guide

## Purpose

The `META` directory contains all records, policies, and documentation related to the software engineering (SWE) process, requirements, tasks, and issues for this project. It serves as the central location for process management and project organization artifacts.

## Usage

- **Policies:** SWE policies and best practices are documented here (e.g., `SWE_POLICY.md`).
- **Issues:** All issues are organized in `META/ISSUES/OPEN` (for open issues) and `META/ISSUES/CLOSED` (for closed issues), with directories named using descriptive kebab-case names **mandatory** prefixed with date in yyyy-mm-dd format. Each issue directory contains a README.md file and any other relevant files for that issue. 

DO NOT PUT ANY FILES DIRECTLY IN THE `META/ISSUES/OPEN` OR `META/ISSUES/CLOSED` DIRECTORIES. ALWAYS CREATE A NEW DIRECTORY FOR EACH ISSUE.

## AI Responsibility

- The AI is responsible for keeping the `META` directory and this guide up to date, concise, and free of redundancy.
- The AI must ensure all relevant process changes, new policies, and important records are reflected here promptly.
