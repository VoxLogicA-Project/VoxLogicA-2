# META Directory Guide

## Purpose

The `META` directory contains all records, policies, and documentation related to the software engineering (SWE) process, requirements, tasks, and issues for this project. It serves as the central location for process management and project organization artifacts.

## Usage

- **Record Keeping:** All requests, requirements, tasks, issues, and process-related discussions in chat must be formally recorded in the `META` directory.
- **Policies:** SWE policies and best practices are documented here (e.g., `SWE_POLICY.md`).
- **Guides:** This `GUIDE.md` provides an overview and must be kept up to date.
- **Emergent Structure:** The structure of `META` is flexible and should evolve as needed. Do not use rigid templates or boundaries.
- **Issues:** All issues are organized in `META/ISSUES` with directories named ISSUE_X where X is the GitHub issue number. Each issue directory contains a README.md file and any other relevant files for that issue.

## AI Responsibility

- The AI is responsible for keeping the `META` directory and this guide up to date, concise, and free of redundancy.
- The AI must ensure all relevant process changes, new policies, and important records are reflected here promptly.
