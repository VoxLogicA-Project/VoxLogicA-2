# Issue: Operations Class Redundancy Cleanup

## Status
**COMPLETED** âœ… (2025-06-06)

## Description
The `Operations` class in `voxlogica/reducer.py` contained redundant memoization logic with two different mechanisms for identifying duplicate operations:
1. A fast lookup cache using tuple keys: `(operator, tuple(sorted(arguments.items())))`  
2. Content-addressed SHA256 hashing of canonical JSON

This redundancy was unnecessary since the SHA256 approach already handles argument ordering and type consistency reliably.

## Changes Made

### Before (Redundant Implementation)
```python
class Operations:
    def __init__(self):
        self.by_content: Dict[tuple, OperationId] = {}  # Redundant cache
        self.memoize = True
    
    def find_or_create(self, operator, arguments):
        if self.memoize:
            key = (operator, tuple(sorted(arguments.items())))  # Manual key creation
            if key in self.by_content:
                return self.by_content[key]
        return self.create(operator, arguments)
    
    def create(self, operator, arguments):
        new_id = self._compute_operation_id(operator, arguments)  # SHA256 computation
        if self.memoize:
            key = (operator, tuple(sorted(arguments.items())))  # Duplicate key logic
            self.by_content[key] = new_id
        return new_id
```

### After (Simplified Implementation)
```python
class Operations:
    def __init__(self):
        self.created_operations: Set[OperationId] = set()  # Simple set tracking
        self.memoize = True
    
    def find_or_create(self, operator, arguments):
        operation_id = self._compute_operation_id(operator, arguments)  # Direct SHA256
        if self.memoize and operation_id in self.created_operations:
            return operation_id
        return self.create(operator, arguments)
    
    def create(self, operator, arguments):
        operation_id = self._compute_operation_id(operator, arguments)
        if self.memoize:
            self.created_operations.add(operation_id)  # Simple set addition
        return operation_id
```

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Redundancy**: No more dual memoization mechanisms
2. **Safer**: Canonical JSON + SHA256 is more reliable than manual tuple creation
3. **Simpler**: Reduced code complexity and potential for bugs
4. **More Reliable**: The canonical JSON approach handles edge cases better than manual sorting
5. **Future-Proof**: SHA256 content addressing is inherently extensible

## Verification

- All SHA256 memoization tests continue to pass
- The Operations class functionality remains identical
- No breaking changes to the public API
- Memory usage slightly improved (no duplicate key storage)

## Technical Details

The original implementation was computing both:
- A manual tuple key for fast dictionary lookup
- A SHA256 hash for the actual operation ID

Since the SHA256 hash IS the operation ID and is deterministic, we can use it directly for memoization without the intermediate tuple-based cache.

## Related Issues

This cleanup was identified during code review and aligns with the project's content-addressed architecture improvements.
