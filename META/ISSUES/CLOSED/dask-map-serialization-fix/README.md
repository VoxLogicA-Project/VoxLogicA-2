# DASK_MAP Serialization Fix - RESOLVED

## Issue Summary
The `dask_map` primitive was failing due to serialization errors when trying to store non-serializable results (closures, certain Python objects) in the persistent storage backend.

## Root Cause
The storage backend (`storage.py`) was attempting to pickle all results for persistent storage, causing failures when encountering non-serializable objects like:
- Lambda functions and closures
- Certain SimpleITK objects  
- Other complex Python objects

## Solution Implemented
Modified `StorageBackend` class in `/Users/vincenzo/data/local/repos/VoxLogicA-2/implementation/python/voxlogica/storage.py` to:

1. **Dual Storage Strategy**: Added memory cache alongside persistent database storage
2. **Graceful Fallback**: Try pickle serialization first, fall back to memory cache if it fails
3. **Transparent API**: Maintained existing `store()`, `retrieve()`, and `exists()` methods
4. **Thread Safety**: Used threading.Lock for memory cache access
5. **Statistics Tracking**: Updated statistics to include memory cache count

### Key Changes Made:
- Added `_memory_cache` dict and `_memory_cache_lock` to `__init__`
- Modified `store()` to attempt pickle first, use memory cache on failure
- Updated `retrieve()` to check both persistent storage and memory cache
- Modified `exists()` to check both storage locations
- Updated `get_statistics()` to include memory cache information
- Applied same changes to `NoCacheStorageBackend`

## Testing Results
- **Before**: `./voxlogica run --no-cache test_simpleitk.imgql` failed with serialization errors
- **After**: Test completes successfully, returns list of MinimumMaximumImageFilter objects
- **Verification**: Direct storage tests confirm serializable objects go to DB, non-serializable to memory

## Status: RESOLVED âœ…
The core serialization issue is fixed. The test now runs to completion with correct results.

## Next Steps
While the serialization issue is resolved, there are still evaluation errors in the dask_map implementation itself (unrelated to storage). These may need separate investigation if they impact functionality.
