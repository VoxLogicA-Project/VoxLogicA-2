# Fixed basic_test Import Path Issue

## Problem Description
The basic_test was failing with the error "Internal error in reducer: unknown command type" despite the parser working correctly and generating proper Declaration and Print command objects.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by mismatched import paths between the parser and reducer modules:

- **Parser creates objects**: `implementation.python.voxlogica.parser.Declaration`
- **Reducer expected types**: `voxlogica.parser.Declaration` 

This mismatch meant that `isinstance()` checks in the reducer were failing, causing all command types to be unrecognized.

## Solution
Fixed import statements in `/implementation/python/voxlogica/reducer.py`:

1. Changed `from voxlogica.parser import (...)` to `from .parser import (...)`
2. Changed `from voxlogica.error_msg import (...)` to `from .error_msg import (...)`  
3. Changed `from voxlogica.parser import parse_import` to `from .parser import parse_import`

## Testing
- basic_test now passes successfully
- Parser correctly creates 4 commands: 3 Declarations + 1 Print
- Reducer successfully processes all commands and creates WorkPlan with 4 operations and 1 goal

## Files Modified
- `/implementation/python/voxlogica/reducer.py`: Fixed import paths from absolute to relative

## Test Results
```
[SUCCESS] python completed successfully
Operations: 4
Goals: 1
```

## Status
**CLOSED** - Issue resolved and basic_test is now working correctly.
