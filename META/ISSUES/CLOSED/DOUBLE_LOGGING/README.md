# Double Logging Issue

## Problem
All log messages are appearing twice in the console output during VoxLogicA operations. This creates noise and makes debugging more difficult.

## Root Cause Analysis
The codebase has two separate logging configurations that both add StreamHandlers:

1. **Standard Python Logging (main.py)**
   - `setup_logging()` function calls `logging.basicConfig()`
   - Creates a StreamHandler on the root logger
   - Used by CLI commands and API endpoints

2. **Custom Logger Class (error_msg.py)**
   - Singleton `Logger` class with its own StreamHandler
   - Adds handler to 'voxlogica' logger
   - Used throughout the codebase via `Logger.info()`, `Logger.error()`, etc.

## Technical Details
- Messages logged to child loggers (like 'voxlogica.cli', 'voxlogica.execution') bubble up to the root logger
- Both the custom Logger's handler and the root logger's handler process the same message
- This creates duplicate output for every log statement

## Impact
- Cluttered console output
- Difficulty in debugging and log analysis
- Confusion for developers and users

## Proposed Solution
Standardize on one logging approach:

1. **Option A**: Use only standard Python logging
   - Remove custom Logger class
   - Update all `Logger.method()` calls to use standard `logging.getLogger()`

2. **Option B**: Use only custom Logger class  
   - Remove `logging.basicConfig()` calls
   - Ensure Logger class prevents handler duplication
   - Set propagate=False on voxlogica logger to prevent bubbling

## Files Affected
- `implementation/python/voxlogica/main.py` (setup_logging function)
- `implementation/python/voxlogica/error_msg.py` (Logger class)
- Various files using `Logger.method()` calls throughout codebase

## Testing Strategy
- Run existing tests to ensure logging still works
- Verify single message output in both CLI and API modes
- Test different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

## Priority
Medium - Functional issue affecting user experience but not breaking core functionality
