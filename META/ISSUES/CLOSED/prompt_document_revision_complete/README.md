# PROMPT.md Document Revision - COMPLETED

## Issue Description
Successfully completed comprehensive revision of `/doc/dev/dynamic-scheduler/PROMPT.md` to properly present this as an alternative execution backend for VoxLogica-2.

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

## Date: December 2024

## Final Resolution Summary

### Key Understanding Achieved
1. **Alternative Execution Backend**: This is NOT a replacement but an alternative to VoxLogica-2's sequential execution
2. **Actual DAG Node Execution**: Implements node execution (current system only computes DAG structure)
3. **Storage-Based Memory**: Alternative to buffer allocation - stores intermediate results instead
4. **Peer-to-Peer Foundation**: Designed to enable future distributed workload execution
5. **Coexistence Model**: Operates alongside existing sequential execution as alternative backend

### Documents Successfully Updated

#### 1. PROMPT.md - Primary Document
- ✅ **System Overview**: Clarified as "alternative execution engine" alongside sequential execution
- ✅ **Storage Options**: Expanded to include filesystem solutions alongside database options
- ✅ **Context Section**: Added relationship explanation with current VoxLogica-2 implementation
- ✅ **Success Criteria**: Updated to focus on alternative integration rather than replacement
- ✅ **Integration Specifications**: Clarified coexistence with existing execution approaches

#### 2. SEMANTICS.md - Documentation Consistency  
- ✅ **Execution Strategy Section**: Updated title from "Sequential and Parallel Modes" to "Sequential and Alternative Execution Models"
- ✅ **Alternative Models Section**: Added section explaining dynamic scheduling and storage-based alternatives
- ✅ **Coexistence Documentation**: Clarified that alternative execution models can coexist with sequential execution

#### 3. META Issue Documentation
- ✅ **Corrected Understanding**: Updated META/ISSUES/OPEN/prompt_document_revision/README.md to reflect final resolution
- ✅ **Status Updated**: Marked as RESOLVED with comprehensive summary
- ✅ **Created Closure Record**: This completion record in META/ISSUES/CLOSED/

### Key Technical Clarifications Made

#### Current VoxLogica-2 State
- **DAG Computation**: Computes DAG structure but does not execute nodes
- **Sequential Execution**: Uses sequential execution with static buffer allocation  
- **Memory Management**: Current buffer allocation strategies manage memory during execution

#### Alternative Dynamic Scheduler Approach
- **DAG Execution**: Implements actual execution of DAG nodes (not just structure)
- **Dynamic Scheduling**: Alternative to sequential execution enabling concurrent/distributed execution
- **Storage-Based Memory**: Replaces buffer allocation with persistent storage of intermediate results
- **Peer-to-Peer Ready**: Designed to support future distributed/peer-to-peer workload execution

### Implementation Options Clarified
- **Database Solutions**: SQLite, DuckDB, embedded databases
- **Filesystem Solutions**: JSON metadata + binary files (equally acceptable)
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combinations of database + filesystem as appropriate
- **Peer-to-Peer Readiness**: Storage format supports future distributed execution

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Outcomes
1. **Clear Alternative Positioning**: Document now correctly positions this as alternative execution backend
2. **Flexible Implementation Options**: Both database and filesystem approaches supported
3. **Coexistence Framework**: Clear integration strategy with existing sequential execution
4. **Documentation Consistency**: SEMANTICS.md updated to reflect alternative execution models
5. **Proper Context**: Relationship to current VoxLogica-2 implementation clearly explained

### No Conflicts Created
- ✅ Does not conflict with existing sequential execution design
- ✅ Does not require changes to current buffer allocation system
- ✅ Presents as additive alternative rather than replacement
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with existing CLI/API interfaces

## Final Status: SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION

The PROMPT.md document now accurately represents the requirements for an alternative execution backend that:
- ✅ Implements actual DAG node execution
- ✅ Uses storage instead of buffer allocation  
- ✅ Prepares for distributed/P2P execution
- ✅ Coexists with current sequential execution
- ✅ Supports flexible storage implementations (database OR filesystem)
- ✅ Maintains integration with existing VoxLogica-2 interfaces

**No further revisions required.**
