# Issue: Missing print_buffer_assignment Function Import

## Status
**RESOLVED** ✅ - 2025-06-06

## Problem Statement
The `buffer_allocation.py` module was missing the `print_buffer_assignment` function that was being imported by `features.py`, causing an import error:

```
Unexpected error: cannot import name 'print_buffer_assignment' from 'voxlogica.buffer_allocation'
```

## Root Cause
The `buffer_allocation.py` module had been recently implemented with the core buffer allocation algorithm, but the `print_buffer_assignment` function referenced in the SKETCH_SOLUTION.md documentation was not implemented.

## Solution
1. **Implemented `print_buffer_assignment` function**: Added the missing function with the correct signature based on how it's used in `features.py`:
   ```python
   def print_buffer_assignment(
       workplan: WorkPlan, 
       buffer_assignment: Dict[OperationId, int], 
       type_assignment_func: Callable[[OperationId], Any]
   ) -> None
   ```

2. **Fixed `compute_buffer_allocation` signature**: Corrected the function to accept a callable `type_assignment` parameter instead of a dictionary, matching how it's called from `features.py`:
   ```python
   def compute_buffer_allocation(
       workplan: WorkPlan,
       type_assignment: Callable[[OperationId], Any],
       type_compatibility: Callable[[Any, Any], bool],
   ) -> Dict[OperationId, int]
   ```

## Implementation Details
- **Function Location**: `/Users/vincenzo/data/local/repos/VoxLogicA-2/implementation/python/voxlogica/buffer_allocation.py`
- **Integration Point**: `features.py` imports and calls the function when `compute_memory_assignment=True`
- **Output Format**: Clean console output showing buffer assignments grouped by buffer ID

## Verification
1. **Import Test**: ✅ `print_buffer_assignment` imports successfully
2. **Function Test**: ✅ CLI command `python -m voxlogica.main run test.imgql --compute-memory-assignment` works correctly
3. **Output Verification**: ✅ Shows expected buffer assignment format:
   ```
   === Buffer Assignment ===

   Buffer 0:
     8aed49ff: + (type: basic_type)

   Buffer 1:
     05cf0973: 2.0 (type: basic_type)
     9bf09932: 1.0 (type: basic_type)

   Total buffers allocated: 2
   Total operations: 3
   ```
4. **Regression Test**: ✅ All existing tests continue to pass

## Related Documentation
- **Issue Reference**: META/ISSUES/OPEN/static_buffer_reuse/SKETCH_SOLUTION.md
- **Feature Documentation**: Listed `print_buffer_assignment()` as console output function
- **Implementation Algorithm**: Conservative chain-based buffer reuse with safety guarantees

## Files Modified
- `implementation/python/voxlogica/buffer_allocation.py`: Added `print_buffer_assignment` function and fixed `compute_buffer_allocation` signature

## Impact
- ✅ Buffer allocation feature is now fully functional
- ✅ CLI memory assignment option works correctly  
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with the documented API expectations
