# Operation Type to Node Type Migration

**Status**: CLOSED  
**Date Completed**: 2025-06-11  
**Priority**: High  

## Summary

Successfully migrated the VoxLogicA codebase from using a single "operation" type to a unified "node" type system that can represent both operations and constants as distinct node types.

## Background

Previously, the system represented both function calls and constants as "operations", which created ambiguity when trying to distinguish between string constants and function symbols. This made the execution engine and converters harder to understand and maintain.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Data Structure Changes

**reducer.py**:
- Introduced `ConstantValue` dataclass to represent constant values
- Introduced `Operation` dataclass to represent function operations  
- Created unified `Node` type as union of `ConstantValue | Operation`
- Changed `WorkPlan.operations` to `WorkPlan.nodes` containing all node types
- Added `WorkPlan.operations` and `WorkPlan.constants` properties for backward compatibility
- Fixed `_compute_node_id` to handle dataclass serialization with `canonicaljson`

**Type System Updates**:
- Replaced `OperationId` type alias with `NodeId` throughout codebase
- Updated all type hints to use `NodeId` consistently

### 2. Execution Engine Fixes

**execution.py**:
- Fixed argument resolution to handle `ConstantValue` nodes correctly
- Updated `_resolve_arguments` to look up constants in `workplan.nodes`
- Fixed `_categorize_operations` to properly handle both node types
- Updated primitive loading to extract values from `ConstantValue` objects

### 3. Converter Updates

**json_converter.py**:
- Updated `WorkPlanJSONEncoder` to handle `ConstantValue` objects
- Modified output format to use `nodes` array with `type` field ("constant" or "operation")
- Added proper unwrapping of `ConstantValue` objects

**dot_converter.py**:
- Updated to handle both `Operation` and `ConstantValue` nodes
- Added distinct labeling for constants vs operations in DOT output

### 4. Buffer Allocation Updates

**buffer_allocation.py**:
- Replaced all `OperationId` references with `NodeId`
- Updated function signatures and type hints
- Maintained compatibility with existing algorithm logic

### 5. Feature System Updates

**features.py**:
- Updated JSON serialization to use `WorkPlanJSONEncoder`
- Ensured proper handling of new node structure

**main.py**:
- Fixed import for JSON encoder

### 6. Visualization Updates

**static/index.html**:
- Updated JavaScript to handle new `nodes` structure instead of `operations`
- Added visual distinction between constants (green) and operations (blue)
- Modified node labeling to show constant values appropriately

## Testing

- All existing tests continue to pass (9/9 passed)
- Manual testing confirms:
  - Parsing and reduction work correctly
  - Execution engine properly resolves constants and operations
  - JSON export produces correct node structure
  - DOT export shows proper node types
  - Buffer allocation works with new API
  - Visualization renders both node types correctly

## Verification

The migration was verified by running:
```bash
./voxlogica run --execute test.imgql
```

This successfully:
1. Parsed the program
2. Reduced it to nodes with proper types (constants and operations)
3. Executed the computation graph
4. Printed the final result
5. Used content-addressed caching correctly

Sample output structure:
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "eee2f992...",
      "type": "constant", 
      "value": 20.0
    },
    {
      "id": "23302bb6...",
      "type": "operation",
      "operator": "timewaste",
      "arguments": {"0": "eee2f992...", "1": "eee2f992..."}
    }
  ],
  "goals": [...]
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Clearer semantics**: Constants and operations are now distinct types
2. **Better execution**: Argument resolution is more robust
3. **Improved visualization**: Constants and operations have different visual representations
4. **Type safety**: Better type checking throughout the system
5. **No backward compatibility issues**: All existing functionality preserved
