# Dynamic Scheduler Design Documents Creation

## Issue Description
User requested creation of design documents for the Dynamic Scheduler with Database-Backed Memory Allocation system as specified in `/doc/dev/dynamic-scheduler/PROMPT.md`.

## Status: IN PROGRESS

## Date: June 9, 2025

## Requirements Analysis
Based on PROMPT.md, need to create:

1. **Architectural Design Document**: Complete system architecture with component diagrams
2. **Storage Schema**: Storage schema and documentation (database schema OR filesystem structure)
3. **API Specification**: Detailed API interface definitions with examples
4. **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step implementation roadmap with milestones
5. **Testing Strategy**: Unit testing, integration testing, and performance testing approaches
6. **Deployment Guide**: Configuration, deployment, and operational procedures

## Key Technical Requirements
- Alternative execution engine to VoxLogica-2's sequential execution
- Database-backed memory allocation with zero-copy approach
- Storage of DAG node results (primitives, binary data, large objects, nested records, datasets)
- Support for streaming I/O and concurrent access
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, Windows)  
- Peer-to-peer distribution readiness
- Integration with existing VoxLogica-2 CLI/API

## Target Directory
All design documents will be created in `/doc/dev/dynamic-scheduler/`

## Approach
Will create comprehensive design documents following software engineering best practices, focusing on practical implementation while maintaining the alternative nature of this execution backend.
