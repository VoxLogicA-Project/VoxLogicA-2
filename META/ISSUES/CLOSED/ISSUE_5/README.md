# Python Comment Parsing Issue in Lark Parser

## Description

The Python implementation of VoxLogicA-2 fails to parse imgql files that contain comments. The parser raises an `UnexpectedToken` error when it encounters comment lines. This issue only affects the Python implementation; the F# implementation handles comments correctly.

## Reproducing the Issue

The issue can be reproduced using the attached test file `comment_parsing_failure.imgql`. This file includes standard "//" comments before function declarations.

Run the test with:

```bash
cd tests
python -m unittest test_voxlogica.py
```

The test will fail with an `UnexpectedToken` error when trying to parse comments.

## Error Log

```

Previous tokens: Token('OPERATOR', '//')
```

## Severity

Medium - This issue prevents parsing imgql files with comments in the Python implementation, which hampers documentation and code readability.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by two problems in the grammar definition:

1. The `OPERATOR` pattern `/[A-Z#;:_'.|!$%&\/^=*\-+<>?@~\\]+/` was matching the comment start sequence `//` as an operator token.
2. Since the `//` was already matched as an operator, the subsequent comment text was being interpreted as unexpected tokens.

## Solution

The issue has been fixed by:

1. Modifying the `OPERATOR` pattern to use a negative lookahead, preventing it from matching `//`:
   ```
   /(?!\/{2})[A-Z#;:_'.|!$%&\/^=*\-+<>?@~\\]+/
   ```
2. Simplifying the `COMMENT` pattern definition to correctly match comment lines:
   ```
   COMMENT: "//" /[^\n]*/
   ```
3. Adding explicit `%ignore NEWLINE` to ensure proper handling of line breaks.

With these changes, the parser now correctly identifies and ignores comment lines in the imgql files, allowing for proper documentation and readability in the code.

## Status

- FIXED. The comment parsing issue has been resolved and verified with the test script. The grammar now properly ignores comments starting with "//".
- COMPLETED and MERGED. Merge commit SHA: 532075ad7494e07334738d3d6aa4e165bc3739b9

## Verification

The fix was tested with the provided `reproduce.py` script, which successfully parsed a file containing comments without any errors. The test output confirms that the parser correctly identifies and ignores comments.

## GitHub Issue Reference

This issue is tracked in GitHub issue: https://github.com/VoxLogicA-Project/VoxLogicA-2/issues/5

## Ongoing Work

- [2024-06-09] The parser grammar will be fixed to ensure comments (// ...) are always ignored, resolving the Unexpected token error. This is part of the fix for Issue 5 and follows SWE policy for traceability.
