# Task: Python Implementation of VoxLogicA

## Summary

This task involved creating a Python implementation of VoxLogicA with the following characteristics:

- Implements the full VoxLogicA language specification
- Uses a clear and modular design for easy maintenance
- Uses Lark for parsing with a well-defined grammar
- Provides both CLI and HTTP API interfaces with exact feature parity
- Uses standard, widely adopted tools for dependencies, linting, and testing
- Includes comprehensive documentation and test suites
- Follows Python best practices and modern development standards

## Issue

- Original GitHub Issue: https://github.com/VoxLogicA-Project/VoxLogicA-2/issues/1

## Status

- ✅ Implementation completed
- ✅ Created modular design with Lark parser, reducer, error handling, CLI, and API components
- ✅ Implemented FastAPI server and Typer CLI
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/` directory
- ✅ Added documentation (README, inline docs)
- ✅ Tested implementation and fixed issues with parser and reducer

## Implementation Details

- **Directory Structure:** Implementation located in `implementation/python/`
- **Parser:** Uses Lark for parsing with a well-defined grammar
- **Reducer:** Implements reducer logic for program evaluation
- **CLI:** Uses Typer for command-line interface
- **API:** Uses FastAPI for HTTP API server
- **Dependencies:** Uses widely adopted tools (FastAPI, Typer, Lark)
- **Tests:** Comprehensive test suite in `tests/` directory

## Architecture

The implementation follows a clean architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Parser**: Handles parsing of imgql programs into an AST
2. **Reducer**: Evaluates the AST and manages the DAG of operations
3. **CLI**: Command-line interface for direct usage
4. **API**: HTTP interface for programmatic access
5. **Core**: Core data structures and business logic

## Completion

- Status: COMPLETE
- All implementation, documentation, and tests are up to date in the main branch
- All traceability, documentation, and testing requirements satisfied as per SWE_POLICY.md
