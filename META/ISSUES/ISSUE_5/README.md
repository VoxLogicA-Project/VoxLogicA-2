# Python Comment Parsing Issue in Lark Parser

## Description

The Python implementation of VoxLogicA-2 fails to parse imgql files that contain comments. The parser raises an `UnexpectedToken` error when it encounters comment lines. This issue only affects the Python implementation; the F# implementation handles comments correctly.

## Reproducing the Issue

The issue can be reproduced using the attached test file `comment_parsing_failure.imgql`. This file includes standard "//" comments before function declarations.

Run the test with:

```bash
cd tests
python -m unittest test_voxlogica.py
```

The test will fail with an `UnexpectedToken` error when trying to parse comments.

## Error Log

## Severity

Medium - This issue prevents parsing imgql files with comments in the Python implementation, which hampers documentation and code readability.

## Possible Causes

The issue is likely related to how the Lark parser is configured to handle comments in the grammar definition. In the Python implementation, the comment rule appears to be incorrectly defined, causing tokens after the "//" to be treated as unexpected tokens.

Looking at the grammar definition in `implementation/python/voxlogica/parser.py`, the COMMENT rule appears to be:

```python
COMMENT: "//" /[^\n]*/ NEWLINE
```

But it's possible that:

1. The rule isn't being properly included for tokenization
2. The comment handling differs between the lexer and parser phases
3. There might be missing components in the comment rule definition

## Notes

The F# implementation correctly handles the same comments without any issues.

## Ongoing Work

- [2024-06-09] The test script reproduce.py was updated to use the correct test file path. The script now runs, and the comment parsing issue is confirmed to still exist (Unexpected token error on comment lines). See SWE_POLICY.md for traceability.
