# IMPLEMENTATION: SHA256-Based Content-Addressed DAG Node IDs

## Status

**COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented SHA256-based content-addressed IDs for all DAG nodes in the reducer module.

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made

1. **Modified OperationId Type**: Changed from `int` to `str` to support SHA256 hash strings.

2. **Updated Operations Class**: Added content-addressed ID computation using SHA256 and canonical JSON:

   - `_compute_operation_id()`: Computes SHA256 hash of canonical JSON representation
   - `_operator_to_dict()`: Converts operators to JSON-serializable format
   - Hash collision detection and handling

3. **JSON Canonicalization**: Using `canonicaljson` library for RFC 8785-compliant JSON normalization.

4. **Enhanced Memoization**: The new ID scheme improves memoization by:

   - Enabling cross-session result reuse (same computation = same ID)
   - Providing deterministic IDs regardless of execution order
   - Supporting distributed caching and result sharing

5. **Updated WorkPlan**: Modified to track operation-to-ID mappings for DOT generation and debugging.

6. **Made Operations Hashable**: Updated Operation dataclass to support being used as dictionary keys.

### Dependencies Added

- `canonicaljson>=2.0.0` - For RFC 8785 JSON canonicalization

### Key Features

#### Content-Addressed Properties

- **Deterministic**: Same operation content always produces same SHA256 ID
- **Unique**: Different operations produce different IDs
- **Recursive**: Operation IDs include the IDs of their argument operations
- **Cross-session consistent**: Same operation in different sessions has same ID

#### Memoization Benefits

- **Eliminates duplicates**: Identical operations are automatically deduplicated
- **Cross-session reuse**: Results can be cached and reused across program runs
- **Distributed support**: IDs are portable across different execution environments
- **Performance**: Reduces redundant computation by reusing previously computed results

### Testing

Created comprehensive tests demonstrating:

1. **Basic functionality** (`test_sha256_memoization.py`):

   - SHA256 ID determinism
   - ID uniqueness for different operations
   - Basic memoization correctness
   - Argument order independence
   - SHA256 format validation

2. **Advanced scenarios** (`test_sha256_memoization_advanced.py`):

   - Complex Fibonacci-like computations
   - Cross-session memoization simulation
   - Deep nesting with subcomputation reuse
   - Performance benefits demonstration

3. **Backward compatibility** (`test_dag_dict_args.py`):
   - Updated to handle string-based operation IDs
   - All existing functionality preserved

### Example Usage

```python
# Create operations with automatic SHA256 ID generation
ops = Operations()

# Basic operations get deterministic IDs
id1 = ops.find_or_create(NumberOp(42), {})
id2 = ops.find_or_create(NumberOp(42), {})
assert id1 == id2  # Same operation, same ID

# Complex operations include argument IDs in their hash
id3 = ops.find_or_create(IdentifierOp("add"), {"0": id1, "1": id1})

# IDs are 64-character SHA256 hex strings
print(id1)  # e.g., "8ac4f5000f0fb324e544079c3b6802741f6928b7e2eec1b89ca44d3afc122da6"
```

### Performance Impact

- **Computation**: Minimal overhead for SHA256 computation vs. integer increment
- **Memory**: Slightly higher memory usage for string IDs vs. integers
- **Memoization**: Significant performance gains in programs with repeated subcomputations
- **Cross-session**: Enables result caching and reuse, major performance benefit for complex workflows

### Future Enhancements

The content-addressed ID foundation enables:

1. **Persistent result caching**: Store computation results by ID for reuse
2. **Distributed execution**: Share partial results across different machines
3. **Incremental computation**: Only recompute changed parts of a workflow
4. **Provenance tracking**: Full reproducibility and audit trails
5. **Result sharing**: Exchange precomputed results between users/teams

## Verification

All tests pass:

- ✅ SHA256 IDs are deterministic and unique
- ✅ Memoization prevents duplicate operations
- ✅ Cross-session consistency demonstrated
- ✅ Complex programs benefit from efficient memoization
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

The implementation fully satisfies the requirements in `doc/dev/SEMANTICS.md` and provides a solid foundation for advanced result caching and distributed execution features.
