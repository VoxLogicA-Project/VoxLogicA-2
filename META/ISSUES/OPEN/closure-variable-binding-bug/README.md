### CRITICAL BUG REPORT: Closure Variable Binding Issue

**Date:** 7 luglio 2025
**Severity:** Critical
**Component:** Closure System / Variable Binding

#### Problem Description
The for loop execution system has a critical bug where loop variables are not properly bound to their iteration values. This causes all iterations to generate the same operation ID, leading to incorrect memoization behavior.

#### Reproduction
```voxlogica
import "test"
let data = for i in range(1,100) do impure(i)
print "data" data
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- `impure` should be called 99 times with values 1, 2, 3, ..., 99
- Result should be `[1, 2, 3, ..., 99]`

**Actual Behavior:**
- `impure` is called only once with a random value (e.g., 81)
- Result is `[81, 81, 81, ..., 81]` (99 copies of the same value)

#### Debug Evidence
From debug output:
- Closure executed many times: `"Executing closure: variable=i, expression=impure(i)"`
- Same operation ID reused: `"Retrieved expression result from cache: 83712aa5..."`
- Only one actual computation: `"IMPURE CALLED WITH: 81"`
- Cached result reused for all iterations

#### Root Cause
The closure system is not properly binding the loop variable `i` to its iteration value. Instead:
1. All iterations generate the same operation ID (`83712aa5...`)
2. The first iteration computes the result
3. Subsequent iterations retrieve the cached result
4. This causes all array elements to have the same value

#### Impact
- **Critical:** For loops with loop-dependent expressions produce incorrect results
- **Affects:** All VoxLogicA programs using for loops where the loop variable affects the computation
- **Silent failure:** No error is thrown, incorrect results are silently produced

#### Technical Details
- The issue is in the closure variable binding mechanism
- The closure system should create different operation IDs for different values of `i`
- Currently, `impure(i)` is treated as the same expression for all iterations
- This affects the execution engine's memoization system

#### Files Involved
- `implementation/python/voxlogica/reducer.py` - Closure system
- `implementation/python/voxlogica/execution.py` - Execution engine
- `implementation/python/voxlogica/primitives/default/dask_map.py` - For loop execution

#### Test Cases
- `test_impure_debug.imgql` - Reproduces the bug
- Any for loop with loop-dependent expressions

#### Priority
**CRITICAL** - This breaks the fundamental functionality of for loops in VoxLogicA.
