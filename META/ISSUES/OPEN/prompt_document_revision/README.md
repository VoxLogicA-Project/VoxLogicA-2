# Dynamic Scheduler PROMPT.md Document Revision - FINAL

## Issue Description - RESOLVED
The document `/doc/dev/dynamic-scheduler/PROMPT.md` has been successfully revised to correctly present this as an **alternative execution backend** for VoxLogica-2.

## Status: RESOLVED - Document Properly Updated

## Date: December 2024

## Final Understanding - CORRECT

### What This Document Actually Represents
1. **Alternative Execution Backend**: Alternative to VoxLogica-2's sequential execution model
2. **Actual DAG Node Execution**: Implements node execution (current system only computes DAG structure)
3. **Storage-Based Memory Management**: Avoids buffer allocation entirely, stores intermediate results
4. **Peer-to-Peer Foundation**: Enables future distributed workload execution
5. **Flexible Storage Options**: Database OR filesystem implementations acceptable

## Document Final State

### Successfully Clarified Alternative Nature
- ✅ Positioned as **alternative execution engine** alongside sequential execution
- ✅ Explained storage-based approach as alternative to buffer allocation
- ✅ Emphasized actual DAG execution vs current structure-only computation
- ✅ Added coexistence framework with existing systems

### Storage Options Properly Expanded
- ✅ **Database Solutions**: SQLite, DuckDB, embedded databases
- ✅ **Filesystem Solutions**: JSON metadata + binary files acceptable
- ✅ **Hybrid Approaches**: Combinations supported
- ✅ **Peer-to-Peer Ready**: Storage designed for future distributed execution

### Context Section Added
- ✅ **Current State**: Sequential execution, buffer allocation, structure-only DAG computation
- ✅ **Alternative Approach**: Dynamic scheduling, storage-based memory, actual node execution
- ✅ **Integration**: Coexistence model with existing approaches

### Success Criteria Updated
- ✅ Alternative integration (not replacement)
- ✅ Actual node execution capability
- ✅ Distributed readiness for P2P scenarios
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with existing CLI/API interfaces

## Resolution Summary

The document now correctly presents:
1. **Alternative execution backend** - not replacement of existing functionality
2. **Actual DAG node execution** - implements what current system only structures
3. **Storage-based memory management** - alternative to buffer allocation strategies
4. **Peer-to-peer foundation** - enables future distributed execution patterns
5. **Flexible implementation** - supports database OR filesystem approaches
6. **Integration strategy** - coexistence with sequential execution model

## No Further Action Required

The document accurately represents the requirements for an alternative execution backend that:
- Implements actual DAG node execution
- Uses storage instead of buffer allocation
- Prepares for distributed/P2P execution
- Coexists with current sequential execution
- Supports flexible storage implementations (database OR filesystem)
- Overengineering solutions for unclear problems

## Next Actions

1. **Document Revision**: Comprehensive rewrite focusing on actual persistent storage needs
2. **Requirements Analysis**: Survey actual VoxLogica-2 use cases needing persistent storage  
3. **Integration Design**: Define concrete integration points with existing system
4. **Performance Analysis**: Establish realistic performance requirements based on actual usage

## Stakeholder Impact

- **Developers**: May implement unnecessary/conflicting features
- **Users**: May expect features that conflict with system design
- **Documentation**: Inconsistency with actual implementation capabilities
