# SimpleITK Test Issues - Fixed

## Issues Found and Fixed in `test_simpleitk.imgql`

### 1. SimpleITK Filter vs Functional Interface Problem ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: The original test was calling `MinimumMaximumImageFilter(img)` which returned a filter object instead of processing the image.

**Root Cause**: The SimpleITK wrapper was registering all callable objects, including filter class constructors, instead of preferring functional interfaces.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `/implementation/python/voxlogica/primitives/simpleitk/__init__.py` to skip filter class constructors and prefer functional interfaces
- Updated test to use `DiscreteGaussian()` instead of `DiscreteGaussianImageFilter()`
- Used `MinimumMaximum()` functional interface for statistics

### 2. Parser Efficiency Issue ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: `parse_program_content()` was creating parser instances twice unnecessarily.

**Solution**: Modified `/implementation/python/voxlogica/parser.py` to use the global parser instance.

### 3. Unresolved Dependencies in Nested For Loops üîç PARTIALLY RESOLVED

**Problem**: Hash `17e2c67423960f50012c12dd6adc0d6720e89cafc35321dc5c1b1ad548cdf6e2` showing as unresolved dependency.

**Status**: Simple for loops work fine. Issue appears in nested for loops with image processing.

**Investigation**: Suggests issue in Dask closure handling for nested mapped operations.

## Files Modified

1. `/implementation/python/voxlogica/parser.py` - Fixed parser efficiency
2. `/implementation/python/voxlogica/primitives/simpleitk/__init__.py` - Fixed SimpleITK wrapper
3. `/test_simpleitk_fixed.imgql` - Created corrected test file

## Test Results

- **Simple for loops**: ‚úÖ Working perfectly
- **SimpleITK statistics**: ‚úÖ Working (`MinimumMaximum` returns correct tuple)
- **Nested for loops with image processing**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial failures in DiscreteGaussian calls

## Next Steps

- Fix the DiscreteGaussian argument passing in nested for loops
- Investigate the specific unresolved dependency hash
- Consider creating a simpler test for nested image processing workflows

## Working Test

The corrected test file `test_simpleitk_fixed.imgql` demonstrates:
- Proper functional SimpleITK usage
- Working statistics extraction
- Identification of remaining for loop nesting issues
