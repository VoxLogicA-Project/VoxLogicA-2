# Version Synchronization Between setup.py and version.py

## Issue Description

The package version in `setup.py` (0.1.0) was inconsistent with the software version defined in `version.py` (2.0.0-alpha.0.2). This creates confusion and breaks the single source of truth principle for versioning.

## Problem Analysis

1. **Inconsistent Versions**: `setup.py` had a hardcoded version "0.1.0" while `version.py` defined the actual software version as "2.0.0-alpha.0.2"
2. **PEP 440 Compliance**: The original version format "2.0.0-alpha.0.2" was not compliant with Python packaging standards (PEP 440)
3. **Maintenance Burden**: Having versions in two places requires manual synchronization

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Version Import in setup.py

Modified `setup.py` to import the version from `version.py`:

```python
# Import version from the package
from voxlogica.version import __version__

setup(
    name="voxlogica",
    version=__version__,
    # ... rest of setup
)
```

### 2. PEP 440 Compliance

Updated `version.py` to use PEP 440 compliant format:

- **Before**: `"2.0.0-alpha.0.2"`
- **After**: `"2.0.0a2"`

The new format means:
- `2.0.0` - base version
- `a2` - alpha release 2 (equivalent to alpha.0.2)

### 3. Verification

Both package metadata and runtime now report the same version:
- Package version (pip show): `2.0.0a2`
- Runtime version (voxlogica version): `2.0.0a2`

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Version is now defined only in `version.py`
2. **Automatic Synchronization**: `setup.py` automatically uses the correct version
3. **PEP 440 Compliance**: Package can be properly installed and distributed
4. **Consistency**: No more version mismatches between package and runtime

## Version Format Decision

**Consideration**: Should we maintain PEP 440 format or find a way to preserve the original "2.0.0-alpha.0.2" format?

**Options**:
1. **Keep PEP 440**: `2.0.0a2` (current solution)
2. **Dual Format**: Keep original in version.py for display, convert to PEP 440 in setup.py
3. **Change Original**: Update all documentation/references to use PEP 440 format

**Recommendation**: Keep PEP 440 format (`2.0.0a2`) for consistency with Python packaging ecosystem standards.

## Files Modified

- `implementation/python/setup.py` - Import version from version.py
- `implementation/python/voxlogica/version.py` - Update to PEP 440 format

## Status

**COMPLETED** (2025-06-06) - Version synchronization implemented and verified working.

## Testing

- Package installation successful with `pip install -e .`
- Both `pip show voxlogica` and `voxlogica version` report same version: `2.0.0a2`
